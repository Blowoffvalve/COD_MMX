Gov. Caleb Mutfwang of Plateau, has commiserated with the family and friends of late Mr Sylvanus Namang, the State Publicity Secretary of All Progressives Congress (APC).

Mutfwang gave his condolence message on Saturday in Jos during the funeral service of the late APC chieftain.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Namang was a one time General Manager of the Plateau Publishing Corporation (PPC) printers of the Nigerian Standard Newspapers.

NAN also reports that Namang was killed on Feb. 17, by suspected kidnappers in the state.

While calling on Plateau people to be united in the fight against all forms of insecurity, Mutfwang urged them to continue to be each other’s keepers and desist from peddling insinuations that trigger disunity among the people.

“One thing that we need to do again as a people of Plateau is to continue to be our brother’s keepers.

“Like the Hausa people would say, it is only a madman that throws a stone into the market, because you don’t know who you may hit, it could turn out to be your own relationship.

“So, I beg of us, let us stop the rumor mongering and the insinuations, let us look out to God, there is nothing hidden under the sun, everything that has happened under the sun will be revealed.

“If anybody has any shred of evidence that anything wrong was done regarding this death, please make it available, it will be dealt with appropriately,” he assured.

Mutfwang condoled with the family and urged all present that: “death should remind us to number our days. Politicians here present should desist from politicising Namang’s death.

“It is always better as the scriptures admonished to go to the house of mourning than the house of feasting because no matter how crazy you are, when you go to the house of mourning, and you see a casket lying, it puts sense into your mind.

“The prayer therefore for myself and those of us who are here this morning, is that may God teach us to number our days, and to apply our hearts to wisdom.

“The worst disrespect we will give to Mr Namang is to politicise his death, please let us not do that.

“If there is anything we need to do to this family is to ask that the spirit of comfort will descend upon them,” he advised.
