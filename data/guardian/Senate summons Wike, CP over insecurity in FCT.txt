The Senate has summoned the Minister of Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Nyesom Wike and the Commissioner of Police in charge of the territory, Benneth Igweh, over issues bordering on insecurity.

The invitation, the Red Chamber said, had become necessary to enable the duo brief it in a closed-door session concerning insecurity in the FCT and measures being taken to address the menace.

During plenary, yesterday, the Senate observed a minute silence in honour of those killed in the territory by bandits and kidnappers.

The resolutions of the Red Chamber followed its consideration and adoption of a motion entitled, ‘Galadimawa kidnap incident and need to urgently enhance security measures in FCT, Nigeria’, sponsored by Senator Ned Nwoko (PDP, Delta North).

The adopted motion wants the Senate to:
“Urge the Inspector-General of Police (IGP) to see to the installation of Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras in strategic locations within and around Abuja, highways and other major capital cities to bolster surveillance and deter criminal activities;

“Call on the IGP to urgently increase security patrols and surveillance within Abuja and across the nation to proactively combat and prevent further kidnappings; mandate its committees on Defence and Police to recommend robust strategies to prevent future kidnappings within FCT;

“Call for the recruitment of more police personnel to bolster security forces’ capacity to combat kidnappings and other criminal activities effectively; and urge the provision of adequate mobility resources for the police to enhance their ability to respond swiftly to security threats and conduct patrols effectively.”

The report also urged the Senate to call on the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to urgently ensure the functionality of dedicated emergency numbers for police.
