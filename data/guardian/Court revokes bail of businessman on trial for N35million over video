Justice O.O. Abike-Fadipe, presiding over the Special Offences Court in Ikeja, Lagos, has revoked the bail previously granted to Ericbona Ushie, according to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).

Ushie, who is a businessman and politician, is facing trial for an alleged N35 million fraud on 13–count charges bordering on stealing, obtaining under false pretence, use of false documents, forgery, and possession of fraudulent documents.

The court has adjourned the case until June 20, 2024, to allow the defense to challenge video evidence presented by the EFCC. The video shows Ushie in his home instead of being in the custody of the Nigerian Correctional Service.

One of the counts reads: “Ericbona Eliom Ushie, sometime in 2023, in Lagos, within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court, dishonestly converted the total sum of N35,397,000.00, property of Calibration and Non-destructive Services Limited for your own use.”

Another count reads: “Ericbona Eliom Ushie, sometime in 2023 in Lagos within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court with intent to defraud the aggregate sum of N35,397,000.00 property of Calibration and Non-destructive Services Limited under the pretense that the said sum was for the purpose of securing an award of contract from Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC.”

He pleaded “not guilty” to the charges.

Following his plea, counsel to the EFCC, Bilikisu Buhari, told the court that the prosecution had a list of 13 witnesses it intended to call to prove its case. The defence counsel, C.C. Orji had informed the court of the bail application of the defendant.

Orji had prayed the court to admit the defendant to bail, arguing that he had been in EFCC custody since December 2, 2023.

“He is presumed innocent until proven guilty,” he said.

Orji further argued that he did not constitute a flight risk, and pleaded with the court to release him to her on self-recognition. In opposition, the prosecution argued that his detention in EFCC custody was based on a court order.

“He also has pending cases with various courts,” Buhari said.

Justice Abike-Fadipe had declined to release him to the defence counsel, ordered his remand in prison custody, and adjourned till February 22, 2024, for a hearing and ruling on the bail application.

Ruling on the bail application, Justice Abike-Fadipe granted him bail in the sum of N35 million and two sureties in like sum, who must reside and have property within Lagos, with evidence of tax payment in the last three years. The court further ordered that he be remanded in prison custody pending the perfection of the bail conditions.

However, on February 26, 2024, Buhari brought to the attention of the court a viral video on social media, in which the defendant was posing from the comfort of his house at Lekki, Lagos State, grandstanding that he was never arrested, detained or sent to prison by any court.

In the video, which was shown in open court, the defendant, who was supposed to be in prison custody, was seated with a plate of jollof rice, a bottle of water, and a pack of juice at the cozy dining table of his house.

“I wasn’t arrested”, Ushie was seen in the video bragging.

Boasting further, Ushie retorted: “It baffles me, the energy [some people] use to try to destroy…It is disheartening… I am sitting in the comfort of my house… Today is the 18th February [2024] Sunday, the day before yesterday was 16th… I don’t know, one element of no commercial value posted something on Facebook; anybody can sponsor any post… and then, they go ahead to say that me, Ericbona Eliom Ushie, Honourable, [that] I am in prison… e be like say Nigeria Prisons dem don dey get prison wey dey [fine] like this [my beautiful house] o.”

Upon seeing the video, Justice Abike-Fadipe expressed surprise and stood down the bail earlier granted to the defendant.

The court further ordered that he should remain in prison custody till June 20, 2024, when the defence is expected to refute the said video.
