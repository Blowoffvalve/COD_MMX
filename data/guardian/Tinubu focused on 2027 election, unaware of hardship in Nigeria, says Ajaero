Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) President Joe Ajaero has slammed President Bola Ahmed Tinubu over his recent remarks during the commissioning of the Red-Line Railway Project.

Tinubu on Thursday said labour unions’ threat to go on strike in the first nine months of his tenure was unacceptable and warned the unions that they are not the only voice of the people.

Ajaero, in a statement on Friday, said Tinubu’s insinuation that Labour lacks the moral ground to challenge his administration, merely nine months into office, is deeply troubling.

He criticised Tinubu’s focus on “partisan issues” and the 2027 election cycle, arguing that it neglects the urgent needs of Nigerians, which “further underscores a disconnect from the realities faced by Nigerians daily.”

“It is regrettable that the President seems oblivious of the profound hardships endured by millions of Nigerians,” Ajaero said.

“The pervasive hunger, unemployment, housing insecurity, and escalating costs of basic necessities such as food and healthcare demand immediate attention and decisive action. Yet, instead of addressing these pressing concerns, President Tinubu appears preoccupied with political calculations and future electoral prospects.”

The NLC president then urged President Tinubu to redirect his efforts towards fulfilling this fundamental duty of public office, rather than engaging in political rhetoric.

He noted that the government must refocus collective energy on addressing the substantive issues that have been the subject of engagement between Labour and the government since June 2023.

These include critical matters such as wage increases, social welfare programmes, infrastructure development, and the revitalization of key sectors such as education and healthcare, Ajaerro added.

Ajaero noted that Tinubu’s administration must be held accountable for the commitments made in previous agreements with Labour, stating that It is disheartening to note the apparent lack of progress in implementing these agreements, despite repeated assurances from the government.

“Nigerians deserve transparency and tangible results, not empty promises and bureaucratic delays,” Ajaero said.

“Furthermore, the use of divisive language and veiled threats against Labour by President Tinubu is unacceptable. It is incumbent upon all stakeholders to foster constructive dialogue and collaboration in addressing the myriad challenges facing our nation.

“Violence and intimidation have no place in a democratic society, and any attempts to suppress dissent will only exacerbate tensions and undermine our collective efforts towards progress and prosperity.”
