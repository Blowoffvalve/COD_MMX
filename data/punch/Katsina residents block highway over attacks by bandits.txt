Scores of residents of Wurna village on Friday blocked the Katsina-Dutsinma highway in Katsina State, to protest the alleged incessant bandits’ attacks on their community.

The villagers stormed the highway as early as 9 am where they set up bonfires made up of dried items.

The development made many road users especially commercial vehicles plying the area to seek alternative routes to continue their trips.

The residents alleged that bandits had continuously attacked and raided their community in recent times.

A resident who pleaded anonymity said, “Bandits have made us know no peace in our community. In the past four days, they have continuously attacked and raided our community. Many of our people have even relocated from the community because of bandits attacks.”

Security operatives later restored normalcy on the highway in the afternoon.

Although there was no official comment from the state police command, Governor Dikko Radda, visited the community on Friday.

According to the Governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Ibrahim Mohammed, Radda sympathised with the residents and directed them   to nominate 10 people who should meet him in Katsina “so that he will know how to cushion their challenge particularly as Ramadan approaches.”

“Your protest is genuine and I feel for you, but please remain calm as the government is doing all it can to stop this,” the governor assured the residents.

The Chief Press Secretary added, “Governor Radda further said that the government will mobilise 100 security personnel to Wurma and we will feed them daily.”
