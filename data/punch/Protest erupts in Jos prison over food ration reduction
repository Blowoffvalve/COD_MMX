Inmates in the Correctional Centre in Jos, Plateau State capital, on Friday, protested the plan to reduce their food ration.

It was gathered that the protest followed a tip-off on the downward review of their food size.

The increasing cost of living in the country sparked demonstrations as youths and women from various parts of the country took to the streets to voice their concerns, joined by the Nigerian Labour Congress to protest the economic challenge.

Protesting the development, the inmates reportedly refused to take orders from the custodial officials while shunning their breakfast.

The custodial officials, however, used tear gas to force them back to their rooms, gathered in the centre of the prison yard, the prisoners were shouting at the top of their voices.

Confirming the development, the Comptroller of the Jos Correctional Centre, Raphael Ibinuhi, said the decision to reduce the food ration was prompted by the high cost of living in the country.

Ibinuhi said, “The problem has to do with the high cost of goods in the market. The contractor in charge of the food said they are being forced by the price of food items to reduce the size of the plate of food.

“So, it is the food size that provoked the protest. I don’t think the protest is necessary because the food challenge and the cost of items a national issues that the Federal Government is already addressing.

“And I want to believe that since it is a national issue, whatever step is taken by the Federal Government to address it will be felt everywhere in the country including the correctional centres.”
