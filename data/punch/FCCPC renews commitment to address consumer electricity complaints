The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has reiterated its commitment to addressing consumer complaints related to electricity.

The acting Chief Executive Officer, FCCCP, Adamu Abdullahi, made the assurance during the electricity consumer complaint resolution platform held in Lagos State on Saturday.

The forum aimed to address billing, metering, transformer, connection and consumer issues at the Ikeja Electricity Distribution Company.

The forum witnessed the active participation of staff members from both IKEDC and FCCPC, who diligently gathered various complaints from consumers over the past four days.

Abdullahi outlined the commission’s objective to address as many consumer issues as possible.

He mentioned that to enhance consumer protection in electricity matters, the commission is undertaking a nationwide campaign sponsored by the MacArthur Foundation.

The acting CEO further urged consumers to exercise patience and adhere to directives as they work towards resolving numerous challenges.

“Our nationwide journey continues as we wrap up in Bauchi and move forward. We’ve received numerous complaints, and our commitment remains steadfast in addressing each one as we progress in our mission,” he noted.

The Head of Governance and Regulatory, IKEDC, Jolaoluwa Adewale, underscored the vital link between consumers and business success, stating, “When there is no consumer, there is no business. We remain committed to resolving all issues to the best of our abilities.

“For the past four days, we have been here addressing your concerns and complaints. While we apologise for any delay, we appreciate your patience,” she said.

Adewale praised the FCCPC for organising the forum and highlighted Ikeja Electric’s collaboration with regulators over the years, particularly in addressing safety and metering issues.

She noted the serious repercussions of energy theft and vandalism while stressing the importance of adhering to legal electricity usage practices.

The Area Inspecting Engineer for Ikeja at the Nigerian Electricity Management Services Agency, Salami Afeez, affirmed the ongoing partnership with FCCPC to fulfill their mandate.

He urged customers to report complaints promptly by using the NEMSA office email available on the website, ensuring efficient communication for issue resolution.

A consumer, Anthony Chukwuemeka, expressed his satisfaction with the forum, stating, “We are happy to see this type of forum so we can be closer to our suppliers and regulators.”

He shared his specific concern, saying, “I paid for the meter in August and we haven’t seen it. Some people here have different issues, ranging from metering to shortages in supply and others. I have been to the NEPA office, and they said they don’t have the meter.”

The power supply situation nationwide has gone from bad to worse since the beginning of this year.

This has prompted the Minister of Power, Adebayo Adelabu, to summon the chief executives of Abuja Electricity Distribution Company and Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company over the worsening power supply in their regions.

Also summoned is the Managing Director, Transmission Company of Nigeria, Sule Abdulazeez, over the deteriorating power situation across the country since January this year.
