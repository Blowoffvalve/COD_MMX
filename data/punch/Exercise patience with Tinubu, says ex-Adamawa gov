A former Governor of Adamawa State and chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, Bala Ngillari, has urged citizens to exercise patience with President Bola Tinubu.

Ngillari stated this during his visit to the Adamawa State Governor, Ahmadu Fintiri’s hometown to congratulate him on his election petition victory at the Supreme Court.

Speaking to journalists after the visit, the APC chieftain, who campaigned for President Bola Tinubu and Senator Aishatu Binani, in the 2023 general elections, Fintiri on his intervention in education, health, and infrastructure.

He said, “There’s a four-year cycle of election and I was amazed when I came in here. I have been following the track of the governor and I am convinced beyond doubt that any fair-minded person(s) will have to thank the governor for what he has done.

“He has put on the ground in infrastructure and interventions in terms of health care and education and so many other things on a scale of 10, I will give him 70 per cent for his performance in his first term and I am sure, we’ll see more dividends of democracy in his second term.

“I am proud of President Ahmed Bola Tinubu, he’s doing exceedingly well given the circumstances he found himself in. Our main problem as citizens is that we don’t have patience. This is how I assess President Tinubu. He has had to make very hard decisions that require only a nationalist to do it. My plea with our citizens is you’ll have to exercise patience.”
