The Minister of Solid Minerals and Development, Dr Dele Alake has ordered Mine Officers of the ministry to investigate the Tuesday night explosion in Ibadan, Oyo State.

Alake gave the directive on Wednesday in Abuja.

“I have directed the ministry’s mine officers who are already on site in Ibadan to join ongoing investigations to find out the immediate and remote causes of the explosion.

“We have ordered a detailed investigation and our officers will work and collaborate with the Oyo State government to know the actual cause,” he said.

The minister’s order was as a result of reports that the explosion was allegedly traceable to the denotation of explosive devices stored by illegal miners.

Meanwhile, the state governor, Seyi Makinde announced that no fewer than two people were reported dead and 77 people injured in the blast.

Also 58 buildings were reported damaged by the explosion.

The minister commiserated with Makinde and the people of Oyo over the incident.
