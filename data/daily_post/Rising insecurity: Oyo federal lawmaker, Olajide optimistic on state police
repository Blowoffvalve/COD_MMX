Member representing Ibadan North West/South in the House of Representatives, Hon. Stanley Olajide has expressed optimism that creation of state police would solve challenges across the country.

He said the spate of security challenges over time has presented the need for creation of state police, assuring that the upper and lower legislative Chambers would pass the law as part of effort to tackle insecurity in Nigeria.

Olajide, who is the House of Representatives Committee Chairman on IT, speaking at a press conference in Abuja, Wednesday, noted that policing at the community level would be possible when state police has been statutorily created.

According to him, “Nigeria cannot continue to accept attacks all over the place. Lawmakers are going to reopen the case of state policing which has generated debates in the public domain in the past.

“Definitely, we’re going to pick this up and it’s going to be in the front burner of the activities of the House as soon as we reconvene as a House.”
