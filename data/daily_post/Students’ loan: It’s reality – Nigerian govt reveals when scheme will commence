The Federal Government has assured that its Student Loan Scheme will kick off this January.

The government said the Scheme is still on track to commence this month, adding that students who apply through its soon-to-be-completed website, can access the facility within 30 days.

The Minister of State for Education, Dr Yusuf Sununu, disclosed this to reporters after the Federal Executive Council meeting on Wednesday.

“January is a reality. Already the website is almost done. Application for beneficiaries is going to be online…and you can access your loan within 30 days,” he said.

DAILY POST recalls that President Bola Tinubu had during the 29th session of the annual Nigeria Economic Summit in Abuja on October 23, 2023, said that by January 2024, the new Students Loan Programme would commence.
