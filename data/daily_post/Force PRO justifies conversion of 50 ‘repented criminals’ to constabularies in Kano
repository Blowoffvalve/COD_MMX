The Force Public Relations Officer, Olumuyiwa Adejobi has clarified that the idea of converting about 50 hardened criminals to police constabularies in Kano State was an initiative under the Community Policing scheme of the state government.

DAILY POST recalls that there were reports that the repented criminals were converted to police constables but Adejobi in a post on his official X handle said they were rather converted to constabularies.

According to him, the initiative followed the peculiarity of the Kano State security situation, stressing that it was not a bad idea.

The post reads, “They were converted to Police Constabularies, not constables. The 2 words are not the same. It’s the Kano State government’s initiative and project under the Community Policing scheme.

“In my opinion, it’s not a bad idea that the government converted them to useful security agents.

“If you know much about Kano, you would understand the idea of the government in this regard. So, study Kano State, and be informed”.
