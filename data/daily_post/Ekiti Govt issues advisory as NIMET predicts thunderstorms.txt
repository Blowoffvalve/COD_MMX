Precautionary measures recommended by the Ministry include: seeking shelter indoors and waiting for the storm to outside; maintaining distance from windows and reflective surfaces, avoiding open flames and gas during thunderstorms; and maintaining safe posture and avoiding using mobile phones during thunderstorms as metal can attract lightning.
