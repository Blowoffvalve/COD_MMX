The Deputy Speaker, Ebonyi State House of Assembly, Chinedu Onah has urged the three tiers of government to increase the salaries of civil servants to cushion the effect of the current economic hardship in Nigeria

Onah made the call while speaking with newsmen after an event in Ohaukwu Local government Area of the state on Friday.

He said that civil servants in the country deserved to be treated fairly like the politicians but regretted that it was not so.

Onah claimed that the current salary status of civil servants in the country is not enough to meet the economic challenges, especially with the hike in the prices of food, increase in school fees and others.

“The federal and state governments should understand the nature of things in this country and the workers should be treated fairly. Let them enjoy the way that politicians are enjoying.

“The salaries of civil servants should be increased. No one who is paid N30,000 or N40,000 can afford N100,000 school fees for their children and you think things are good for such a person. And if he/she has two or four children in school, you see that such a person will be battling hunger.

“I’m among those who are advocating for civil servants to be paid very well so that they will be able to solve their problems. Things are difficult in Nigeria, and if you go outside Ebonyi, you will understand that things are difficult. You will know that we are in paradise in Ebonyi.
