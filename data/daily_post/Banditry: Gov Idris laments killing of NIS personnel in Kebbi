Kebbi State Governor, Nasir Idris, has commiserated with the Nigeria Immigration Service, NIS, over the death of its two personnel serving in the state.

The Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Alhaji Ahmed Idris made this disclosure in a statement issued in Birnin Kebbi on Wednesday.

DAILY POST recalls that the two personnel, Isa Nafi’u and Garba Haruna Fana, lost their lives when a group of suspected bandits launched an attack on the officers on duty at Garin Garba entry point, about 12 kilometers away from Kangiwa, headquarters of Arewa Local Government Area of Kebbi.

The governor’s aide stated that his principal personally attended the funeral prayer for the personnel held in Birnin Kebbi and expressed dismay over the demise of the gallant officers.

He prayed to Almighty Allah to forgive their shortcomings and grant them Jannatul Firdaus.

Idris appealed to the immediate families of the deceased and the NIS to take heart and accept the will of God Almighty in good faith.

He said the sacrifice they made to the nation would never be forgotten as their lives were cut short in the service to their motherland.

The governor encouraged other personnel of NIS not to be deterred by the acts carried out by notorious and bad elements in the society, urging them to continue with their legitimate and lawful duty as scheduled.
